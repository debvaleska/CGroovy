                <h1>Lyrics</h1>
                <p>
                BLACKPINK
                BLACKPINK
                BLACKPINK
                BLACKPINK
                Kick in the door, waving the coco'
                팝콘이나 챙겨 껴들 생각 말고
                I talk that talk, runways I walk-walk
                눈 감고, pop-pop, 안 봐도 척
                One by one then two by two
                내 손끝 툭 하나에 다 무너지는 중
                가짜 쇼 치곤 화려했지
                Makes no sense, you couldn't get a dollar out of me
                자, 오늘 밤이야, 난 독을 품은 꽃
                네 혼을 빼앗은 다음, look what you made us do
                천천히 널 잠재울 fire
                잔인할 만큼 아름다워 (I bring the pain like)
                This that pink venom, this that pink venom
                This that pink venom (get 'em, get 'em, get 'em)
                Straight to ya dome like whoa-whoa-whoa
                Straight to ya dome like ah-ah-ah
                Taste that pink venom, taste that pink venom
                Taste that pink venom (get 'em, get 'em, get 'em)
                Straight to ya dome like whoa-whoa-whoa
                Straight to ya dome like ah-ah-ah
                Black paint and ammo', got bodies like Rambo
                Rest in peace, please, light up a candle
                This the life of a vandal, masked up, and I'm still in CELINE
                Designer crimes, or it wouldn't be me (ooh)
                Diamonds shining, drive in silence, I don't mind it, I'm riding
                Flying private side by side with the pilot up in the sky
                And I'm wyling, styling on them and there's no chance
                'Cause we got bodies on bodies like this a slow dance
                자, 오늘 밤이야, 난 독을 품은 꽃
                네 혼을 빼앗은 다음, look what you made us do
                천천히 널 잠재울 fire
                잔인할 만큼 아름다워 (I bring the pain like)
                This that pink venom, this that pink venom
                This that pink venom (get 'em, get 'em, get 'em)
                Straight to ya dome like whoa-whoa-whoa
                Straight to ya dome like ah-ah-ah
                Taste that pink venom, taste that pink venom
                Taste that pink venom (get 'em, get 'em, get 'em)
                Straight to ya dome like whoa-whoa-whoa
                Straight to ya dome like ah-ah-ah
                원한다면 provoke us
                감당 못해 and you know this
                이미 퍼져버린 shot that potion
                네 눈앞은 핑크빛 ocean
                Come and give me all the smoke
                도 아니면 모 like I'm so rock and roll
                Come and give me all the smoke
                다 줄 세워 봐, 자, stop, drop (I bring the pain like)
                라타타타, 트라타타타
                라타타타, 트라타타타
                라타타타, 트라타타타
                Straight to ya, straight to ya, straight to ya dome like
                라타타타, 트라타타타 (BLACKPINK)
                라타타타, 트라타타타 (BLACKPINK)
                라타타타, 트라타타타 (BLACKPINK)
                I bring the pain like-

                <h4>SHORT DESCRIPTION</h4>
                <p>Ahead of their highly-anticipated second studio album, BORN PINK, BLACKPINK is enchanting with their charisma and talents on its pre-release single, “Pink Venom.”<br>
                The song kicks off with a classic hip-pop beat, with the melody being accompanied by traditional Korean instruments—including a gayageum, a pluck zither containing 12 strings. Additionally, the song's lyrics explore the girls' evil plan of attracting others into their dangerous-yet-lovely “Pink Venom.”<br>
                The music video is YG Entertainment's highest-budget music video, which showcases the girls in multiple dark scenes with an antique-yet-mystical feel.</p>
